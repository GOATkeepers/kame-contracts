### Traction story
Building for Twitch provides lots of advantages for community expansion. The Twitch community is passionate and the information networks are clearly formed.

It's also a massive challenge to find an approach in a mature community. Here's how we've started to chip away at it.

#### 1) Cold contacting streamers on Twitch
We assumed that the most receptive streamers might be those with a limited number of fans - that they might be the most interested in finding a way to build loyalty or make (more) money with their channel. 

We found a data set and filtered 50 streamers at each of the following levels: 250 fans, 500 fans, and 1000 fans. We then attempted to reach them via Twitter (it's not practical to do this on Twitch itself).

We got about an 11% response rate to direct messages, but most were totally confused about what we trying to do.

#### 2) Search the network
It took a bit more time but we were able to connect with several old friends who are streamers. In discussing with them, we were able to clarify where the communication was (are we a competing streaming service? no!). These conversations helped us build the home page for kame.gg.

They were also able to give us valuable advice about the _right_ way to go about getting traction on Twitch - what level of streamer we should actually be approaching and how to do it.

#### 3) TwitchCon
Next up, we are heading to TwitchCon in San Diego 9/27-29 to socialize our product. We'll also be participating in the Extensions hackathon and possibly have the chance to implement new features for Kame.

#### 4) LFG
We are now looking for the right streaming partners to help us grow Kame. Judges: we have a clear idea in mind of what you're looking for! Streamers: if you think you can leverage our platform in innovative ways, please reach out! partners [ a t ] kame.g  g

#### Sums
So far, we have ~20 users signed up for our closed beta. Our Twitter has about the same number of followers. We have seen some excited responses on Twitter and are beginning to see the power of word of mouth - 1/4 of our signups came quickly after one good thread.
